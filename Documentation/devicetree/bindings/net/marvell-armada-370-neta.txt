* Marvell Armada 370 / Armada XP Ethernet Controller (NETA)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-370-neta".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- phy: A phandle to a phy node defining the PHY address (as the reg
  property, a single integer).
- phy-mode: The interface between the SoC and the PHY (a string that
  of_get_phy_mode() can understand)
- clock-frequency: frequency of the peripheral clock of the SoC.

Example:

ethernet@d0070000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-370-neta";
	reg = <0xd0070000 0x2500>;
	interrupts = <8>;
	clock-frequency = <250000000>;
	status = "okay";
	phy = <&phy0>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii-id";
};
